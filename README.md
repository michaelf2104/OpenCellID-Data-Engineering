# OpenCellID-Data-Engineering ⚙️

A **data engineering pipeline** for processing **OpenCellID** datasets.  
Includes **data cleaning, transformation, storage, and visualization** with **Folium** and **Pandas**. This project represents a small part of a larger planned software that will be continuously developed over time to include additional features and improvements.

🌟 **Key Features:**  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** (removing duplicates & empty rows)  
✅ **Snapshot Mechanism** for tracking dataset changes  
✅ **Heatmap Generation** for visualizing cell tower distribution  
✅ **Difference Heatmap** highlighting newly detected cell towers  
✅ **ETL Pipeline** for OpenCellID data processing
